**Scikit-neuromsi** is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the implementation of neurocomputational models of multisensory integration.

Motivation
----------
Research on the the neural process by which unisensory signals are combined to form a significantly different multisensory response has grown exponentially in the recent years. Nevertheless, there is as yet no unified theoretical approach to multisensory integration. We believe that building a framework for multisensory integration modelling would greatly contribute to originate a unifying theory that narrows the gap between neural and behavioural multisensory responses.
