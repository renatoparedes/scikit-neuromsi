# Suggested changes:
# Instead of "stimuli", use the term "sensory estimate"
# Include a measure for the amount of multisensory integration
# (CRE equation)
# Include methods to evaluate multisensory Integration properties:
# Spatio-temporal rule:
# holds that stimuli presented in spatio-temporal proximity have
# a higher probability of being integrated.
# Inverse-effectiveness rule:
# predicts that the amount of integration increases when
# the intensity level of the unimodal components is lowered.
# Reliability rule:
# the sensory modality with the higher reliability
# (e.g., lower signal-to-noise ratio)
# is weighted more heavily when integrating unisensory signals.
