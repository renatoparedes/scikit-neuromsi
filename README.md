**Scikit-neuromsi** is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the implementation of computational models to reproduce data from multisensory integration experimental paradigms.

## Motivation

Research on the the neural process by which unisensory signals are combined to form a significantly different multisensory response (i.e. multisensory integration) has grown exponentially in the recent years. Nevertheless, there is as yet no unified theoretical approach to multisensory integration. We believe that building a framework for multisensory integration modelling would greatly contribute to the progress towards a unifying theory that narrows the gap between neural and behavioural multisensory responses.
